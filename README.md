In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have led to the emergence of innovative applications in various fields such as education, productivity, and personal organization. One of these areas that has benefited greatly from AI integration is digital note-taking. While traditional note-taking tools aimed to help users organize their thoughts and create structured content, a new generation of AI-powered applications have broken through these boundaries.

Note-taking applications now not only help with content creation, but also offer advanced features such as smart summarization, answering questions from marked areas in a given document, and real-time collaboration. Leveraging these innovations, the NoteWiz project aims to use professionally integrated AI APIs to help users achieve the most successful results in their chosen fields. This approach allows comparing various AI models and determining the most suitable model and output. The API-based solution increases the scalability of the project, improves the user experience, and provides a flexible infrastructure.

A versatile and multifunctional note-taking tool designed for enhanced productivity and collaboration, NoteWiz aims to enhance user productivity by combining advanced AI functions such as content summarization, task planning, and collaboration features in a distraction-free, minimalist interface.
