In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have led to the emergence of innovative applications in various fields such as education, productivity, and personal organization. One of these areas that has benefited greatly from AI integration is digital note-taking. While traditional note-taking tools aim to help users organize their thoughts and create structured content, the new generation of AI-powered applications have broken through these boundaries.

Note-taking applications now not only help create content, but also offer the ability to ask questions with AI support. Users can access their accounts from multiple devices and share their notes with other users. Leveraging these innovations, the NoteWiz project aims to use professionally integrated AI APIs to help users achieve the most successful results in their chosen fields. This approach allows comparing various AI models and determining the most suitable model and output. The API-based solution increases the scalability of the project, improves the user experience, and provides a flexible infrastructure.

A versatile and multifunctional note-taking tool designed for enhanced productivity and collaboration, NoteWiz aims to increase user productivity by combining advanced AI functions such as AI support, task scheduling, and multi-device access features in a distraction-free, minimalist interface.
