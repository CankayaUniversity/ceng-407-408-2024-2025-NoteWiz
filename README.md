In recent years, developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have led to the emergence of innovative applications in various fields such as education, productivity, and personal organization. One of these areas that has benefited greatly from AI integration is digital note-taking. While traditional note-taking tools aim to help users organize their thoughts and create structured content, new generation applications powered by AI have overcome these limits.

Note-taking applications no longer only help create content, but also offer advanced features such as smart summarization, answering questions from marked areas in a specific document, and real-time collaboration. Taking advantage of these innovations, the NoteWiz project aims to use professionally integrated AI APIs so that users can get the most successful results in the fields they choose. This approach allows comparing various AI models and determining the most suitable model and output. The API-based solution increases the scalability of the project, improves the user experience, and provides a flexible infrastructure.

As a versatile and multifunctional note-taking tool designed for advanced productivity and collaboration, NoteWiz aims to make the power of artificial intelligence easily accessible to its users.
